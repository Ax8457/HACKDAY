**Description :**

<p align="justify"> In the depths of Gearford, the city where copper and steam shape life, a well-kept secret lies dormant behind the smoky stained-glass windows of the Great Magistrate's Clock. This immense machine, which regulates all the city's automatons and mechanical networks, is protected by rigorous authentication. Only members a few can pass through its doors... at least, in theory. You must root the machine to get your flag.</p>
